It is located in Raj Niwas Marg in the Civil Lines area of North Delhi (India). The Jesuits (Society of Jesus) are an international, Catholic-Christian religious order founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1540. The school is recognised by the Directorate of Education, Delhi Administration, and is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education for the All India Secondary School Examination and All India Senior School Certificate Examination.</div>

            <h1 class="hdgtitle">Our History</h1>
            <div class="line float-container row">
                <div class="column float-child">At the beginning (1960) the school used the grounds and buildings of Hotel Cecil, well known in the British Raj era, purchased for that purpose.[2] The luxury hotel, situated on Rajniwas Marg in the Civil Lines area of Delhi[3] in an 11-acre (45,000 m2) park, had over a hundred rooms, large lawns, and a swimming pool. The Patna Province of the Society of Jesus bought it (including the premises and the services of the hotel employees) from the siblings Mr. Edwin Hotz and Mrs. Pauline White, who were of Swiss/English extraction, and was granted permission by the Commissioner of Delhi to convert it into a residential school for boys.

                    St. Xavier's School was inaugurated on 6 January 1960 by the Archbishop His Excellency James Knox, the representative of the Vatican in India, under the stewardship of Jesuit Fr. Frank Loesch, the first Rector.[2] Loesh went on to buy the adjacent land from the Gujarati Samaj and further on the Bombay House, for later expansion. In the following week admissions for new classes began, starting with Std. V and reaching down to Prep. At the end of the week there were, remarkably, over 700 boys enrolled. It was granted recognition by the Directorate of Education within a month of its inception.

                    Fr. Charles Saldhana, born 13 Jan 1892, attended St. Xavier's college, Bombay. He began his Jesuit career as a professor of mathematics in Pune and Dharwar. He then became the first principal of St. Xavier's College, Ranchi, and from 1951-1952 the first principal of Nirmala College, Delhi University, the present Kirori Mal College. In 1959, at the age of 67, Fr. Charles was asked to be first principal of St. Xavier's in Delhi, his "Benjamin" as he remarked, the child of his old age. He fell ill on the day the school was inaugurated, but remained principal until July. Then he was appointed the headmaster of the prep department and supervised the math program for the entire school. He worked with Frs. Loesch, Rodrigues, and Austin Reinboth in converting the hotel campus into a modern public school. </div>
                <div class="column float-child">After 14 years in Delhi he returned to Patna and remained active in the Jesuit community. In the fall of 1978 he returned to Delhi for his retreat and died on 27 November 1978. He mortal remains are buried in Delhi.
                    The prep classes were held in Bombay House while the five buildings of the hotel accommodated some classrooms and dorms with four to five boys in a room which had the unusual facility of a dressing area and attached toilets. Parts of the residential quarters were renovated to accommodate the staff.

                    At the same time work was begun on the five-storied school buildings. Many of the old buildings were destroyed but some were retained and remain in use, like the Fathers' residence, chapel, hall, Snob's Row, and the swimming pool. Modern classrooms, teacher's tutorial rooms, science laboratories, a library, and a host of other facilities were constructed and a large playing field created by leveling the ground occupied by a road that had cut across the area. By 1965, the Junior and the Senior school buildings were ready and occupied, and Fr. Thomas Kunnunkal took over from Fr. Thomas Athazhapadam. Fr. Kunnunkal, who was later awarded Padma Shri, was responsible for much of the pattern the school adopted in later years. Hostel and boarding facilities were discontinued in December 1971 and the hostel building was converted into a Jesuit house of formation.

                    In the 1980s St. Xavier's switched from English to Hindi as the medium of instruction in junior classes. This measure (along with the decision to set apart 25% of seats for the poor â€“ with subsidized uniform/books/tuition) was a part of changing the image of the school from one of "school for affluents" to one of "school for local needs". A large number of parents pulled their children out of school and many teachers left. The school continued its policy of teaching in Hindi in the belief that younger children learn best in their mother tongue.

                    In 1985, the school admitted girls, starting from prep grade, and is now fully co-educational.

                    In 2007, St Xavier's again switched from Hindi to English as the medium of instruction in junior classes.

                    The IHS (the first three letters in Greek of the name Jesus) symbolise the Society of Jesus; the moonlike chequered and inverted crescent is taken from the Coat-of-Arms of the House of Xavier symbolizing the one after whom the school is named.

                    The inscription at the bottom proclaims that St. Xavier's school was founded in 1960 and is located in Delhi. Esto Vir (Latin for "Be a man") is taken from the farewell instruction of King David to his son and royal successor, Solomon: "I am about to die. Be strong and show yourself a man (Esto Vir) and keep the charge of the Lord, your God walking in His ways and keeping His statutes and commandments so that you may prosper in all you do." Later the meaning of Esto Vir was changed to "Be human".</div>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Using the school canteen
                        You might like to let your child eat lunch from the school canteen once a week or fortnight, or on special occasions.

                        If your child enjoys an occasional canteen lunch, itâ€™s a good idea to talk with your child about which canteen foods and drinks are healthy and which arenâ€™t. You can also help him choose the healthiest food on the menu.

                        Giving your child a healthy breakfast and packing a healthy lunch are the best ways to make sure your child has the energy she needs to get through a busy school day. Packing your childâ€™s lunch can also save you money.

                        Choosing healthy food from the canteen
                        Here are some healthy canteen options and ideas. If theyâ€™re available at your school canteen, these are the options to go for.

                        Sandwiches, rolls and wraps
                        Encourage your child to choose a multigrain, wholemeal or high-fibre white sandwich, roll or wrap. Healthy fillings include salad and lean chicken or beef, fish, eggs or lentil patties.

                        Cold food
                        Your canteen might serve fresh salads, sushi or rice paper rolls â€“ yum!

                        Hot food
                        Here are some healthy hot food options:

                        fresh soups with wholemeal bread rolls on the side
                        pasta or lasagne with fresh tomato, bolognaise or vegetable-based sauce
                        lentil and vegetable hotpot
                        vegetable, chicken or beef curry with rice
                        rice or noodles with lean meat and vegetables.
                        Snacks
                        If your child wants to get a snack from the canteen, encourage him to choose options like these:

                        fruit salads or whole fruit
                        reduced-fat yoghurt and fruit
                        air-popped popcorn (not cooked in oil)
                        reduced-fat cheese with pita or wholemeal crackers
                        vegetable sticks with dip
                        boiled eggs
                        raisin or fruit bread.
                        Itâ€™s a good idea to pack a bottle with tap water for your child to drink and refill throughout the day. This is always healthier and cheaper than buying drinks from the canteen. But if your child wants to buy a drink at the canteen, encourage her to choose water or reduced-fat milk and soy drinks.

                        If you have a healthy food environment at home, it helps your child learn about making better choices when eating away from home.

                        Unhealthy canteen food and drinks
                        â€˜Sometimesâ€™ foods are foods with high amounts of sugar, saturated fat and salt. You see them on a lot of school canteen menus.

                        These foods arenâ€™t healthy for your child. They give your child a short energy boost that can leave him feeling tired for the rest of the day. They can also lead to unhealthy weight gain if your child eats too much of them.

                        Here are sometimes foods that are best kept for lunch orders on special occasions:

                        all deep-fried foods, including chips, chicken nuggets and dim sims
                        hot pastries like sausage rolls and pies
                        cakes, slices and sweet breads like donuts
                        chocolates, lollies, chips and wedges
                        soft drinks, cordial, flavoured mineral water, sports waters, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened waters, flavoured milks, iced tea, breakfast drinks and fruit juice
                        coffee drinks â€“ mocha, latte, cappuccino and so on â€“ and coffee-flavoured milk drinks.
                        Vending machines at school
                        Schools sometimes use vending machines to provide food and drinks. Food stocked in vending machines is often unhealthy â€“ for example, soft drinks, lollies, chips and chocolate bars.

                        Why not send your child to school with an extra piece of fruit or some yoghurt instead? This might reduce the temptation to buy snacks from the vending machine. Or you might like to look at the food in the vending machine with your child and see whether there are any healthy options.

                        School canteen nutrition policy
                        Many school canteens have a nutrition policy.

                        Some schools have developed their policies based on the 2010 National Healthy School Canteens Guidelines, and others base their policies on their state nutrition guidelines for school canteens.

                        If youâ€™re concerned about the nutritional quality of the food sold at your childâ€™s tuckshop, you could ask your school about its canteen policy.

                        Safe foods at school canteens
                        All school canteens must follow careful food preparation procedures. Canteen providers must take proper steps to make sure foods are safe for children to eat.

                        Let your child know that when she buys food from the canteen, she should eat it straight away or put it in the fridge if there is one. These steps help your child avoid food poisoning.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Strong Scores on Standardized Tests. Of those colleges and universities that require the SAT or ACT as part of your application -- and a small (but growing) number of schools do not -- admissions counselors seek scores that match of exceed the scores of their current students. For better or worse, standardized college entrance exam scores are seen as the most objective measure of your college potential. In the process of conducting your research on colleges, you should easily be able to find a profile of the most recently admitted class. (Note: colleges that do not require a standardized test for admission consideration do usually require supplemental materials, such as a graded paper from a core academic course and a portfolio that showcases your strengths, interests, and achievements.)

                        2. High Grade Point Average. It goes without question that grades are an extremely important element of your college application. Colleges will ask you to submit official transcripts from your high school and possibly recalculate your grade point average based on some internal system they use for weighting different types of courses. Your goal, from the first year of high school forward, is to achieve the best grades you can. If you had a rough freshman year, but have since rebounded with much stronger grades, fear not, because colleges certainly look for trends in academic achievement -- and a record of constant improvement when your GPA is not as strong as you would like is a good sign to most admissions counselors about your growth and potential.

                        3. Challenging College-Prep Courses. Your challenge is not just to get the best grades you can -- but to get the best grades you can in the most academically challenging courses as you can. You certainly do not need to enroll in an International Baccalaureate (IB) Program at your high school, but where you have the strengths, skills, and aptitude, you should at least strive for Honors or Advanced Placement (AP) courses. Most colleges will place greater weight on these "tougher" courses -- and even go so far as to rate a B in an advanced class (IB, Honors, AP) on a higher scale than an A in a comparable mainstream class.

                        4. Top Percentage of Class Standing. Class rank and class standing are moving a little further to the back of the pack, partly because class rank means almost nothing in high schools that are at the extremes -- horrible or exceptional. In some of the top high school programs, class rank has been found to actually hurt some of the very best students -- because only so many can be in the top 1, 5, or even 10 percent of the class. Grades obviously drive class rank, so you should of course strive for the very best grades -- and then just hope that the ranking works in your favor or that the colleges you apply to don't use rank as a top criteria for admissions.

                        5. Leadership Positions in a Few Organizations. Most colleges and universities are seeking leaders from within their applicant pool, and you can make your application stand out by having one or two leadership positions over the course of your high school career. Being a leader in one or two organizations means much, much more than simply being a member in 10 clubs and organizations. Not only does leadership show a certain level of maturity and character, but colleges also have an eye to all their student organizations and their need to recruit future leaders. You don't need to be the president of an organization, but you should be an officer of at least one group by the time you're a senior.

                        6. Active Involvement in Community Service. There's no requirement for community service to gain admittance to college, but just about all college-bound high school students have jumped on the bandwagon, volunteering throughout the local community. It seems to be one of these unwritten rules that applicants who volunteer many, many hours in the service of supporting others will become a key campus activist. Regardless of the importance for admission to college, most experts agree on the value and self-fulfillment people get in helping others.

                        7. Insightful and Well-Written Essay(s). Of all the 10 items on this list, the essay either gets the most attention or the least respect -- depending on who you ask. Like some of the other 10 elements on this list, not all colleges require an essay as part of the admissions application. The essay -- or essays -- are a tool used by some universities to learn more about you and why you want to attend their school. Definitely take the time to carefully consider the questions and write, edit, rewrite, and proofread your essays -- with an eye to what the essays reveal about you and your personality. Some admissions counselors admit that an amazing essay can push a marginal applicant into the accepted student group.

                        8. Quality Recommendations from Teachers and Guidance Counselor. The recommendation letters that you ask your teachers and your guidance counselor to write can play a key role in your college application. Ideally, you have a few favorite teachers -- teachers who not only know the quality of your work and academic acumen, but also can talk about some of your personal qualities. It's best to ask your teachers for letters as early as you can so that they have the time to write a quality letter; obviously the most popular teachers will need even more time if they have requests from many of their students.

                        9. Relevant Recommendations from Professionals and Others. One other nice touch -- especially for a college you really want to attend -- is to ask a professional such as a former (or current) boss to write a letter of recommendation for you. Even better if that person has some sort of tie to the college as a donor or alumnus. Other possibilities include your supervisor from one or more of your volunteering/community service projects or a coach from one of the teams you have played for. If you have run your own business, you might ask a favorite customer to write a letter. Finally, you can also ask a family friend or religious leader to write a letter -- but personal references are not as strong as academic or professional ones.

                        10. Work and Entrepreneurial Experiences. While you certainly do not need to have ever held a part-time or summer job or started your own business, if you have some unique experiences, writing about your experiences can be a great essay topic as well as showcasing your professionalism and time-management skills. College admissions folks love self-starters -- applicants with a strong entrepreneurial spirit -- so proudly tell the story of your babysitting, lawn mowing, car detailing, tutoring, painting, or pet-sitting business (or whatever YOUR business is).
